# DocumentGenerator Console Application

This part of the repository hosts the project for the console application, GenerateLabResultReport, that gathers the appropriate data and queries the web API to generate lab reports.

A command file is provided such that execution and cleanup of the console app may be performed in a scheduled task.

Local configurations must be made to the command file and the application's configuration settings, either through the build's configuration file or the project's configuration file, to adapt to the system environment.
